# lab-4

## for my group:

let me know how you all feel about using branches versus just pushing a lot and working on different files...

don't use get-data.sh... all the data is small enough to fit into a repo, so it's just already in the proper folder

### resources (please add if you find any solid tutorials)

#### General

[incredibly helpful tutorial- same dataset (resized), utilizes a bunch of the technologies... ](https://medium.com/ai-techsystems/fingerprint-pattern-classification-using-deep-learning-9eb93757df11)

[research article](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/13/5/750)

[git repository for machine learning class at RIT, tons of sci-kit-learn, numpy, pytorch, etc examples](https://github.com/anton-selitskiy/RIT_ML)

[very much beyond the requirements of this lab, but really interesting nonetheless... very pure mathematical approach to fingerprint classification](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~hpark/papers/finger_jrl.pdf)

#### Sci Kit Learn

[documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

[really basic numeral OCR which might have some stuff in common with fingerprint classification... good intro to sci-kit photo processing tho](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_digits_classification.html)

#### PIL
